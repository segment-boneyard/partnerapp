# Segment Partner App

A Node.js app that demonstrates how to build a Segment OAuth App. Installing this app and getting a working demo going is the fastest way to understand Segment OAuth and get started with building your app.

This app manages a specific destination on a source that the user consents to. To do that, it will need the _scope_ `destination/<slug>` (for example: `destination/clearbrain`).

For documentation, please see the "Enable with Segment" docs:
